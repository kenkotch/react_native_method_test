# react_native_tests
simple react native test examples with redux


### to run tests:
- `yarn install` note: I chose yarn over npm. Either will work but React Native sometimes has issues if you have both yarn.lock and package-lock.json. If you choose npm, delete yarn.lock first.
- `test` OR `yarn testcov` (`test --coverage`)


#### TODO:
- [ ] add actions and action tests
- [ ] add connected components and test
- [ ] add `reselect` library then implement and test
- [ ] add fetchMock tests (and create something to pretend to fetch)
- [ ] add smoke tests
- [ ] and mount tests



##### PR's welcome to develop branch
